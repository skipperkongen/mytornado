## Technical details

Because Greenword is an open ad serving platform, anyone can participate. To avoid having a slow service, 
participating servers are regularly monitored, and nodes with bad performance are either throttled or excluded entirely.

The dreadlock scale goes from 0 (no dreadlocks) to 5 (full on dreadlocks). All content in the network is rated on the dreadlock scale
to allow appropriate filtering.

Users can help adjust the dreadlock rating of an item, when it is displayed in a widget.
